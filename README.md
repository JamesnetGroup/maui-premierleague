## Learning Points for WPF Developers

1. **Familiar XAML**: MAUI uses XAML, making it easier for WPF developers to transition.
2. **Cross-Platform Considerations**: Learn how to design UIs that work across different platforms.
3. **Mobile-First Approach**: Understand the shift from desktop-centric to mobile-first design.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Explore techniques for optimizing app performance on mobile devices.
5. **Platform-Specific Features**: Learn how to implement platform-specific features while maintaining a shared codebase.

## Project Structure

- **Views**: Contains XAML pages and user controls
- **ViewModels**: Implements the presentation logic
- **Models**: Defines data models and business logic
- **Services**: Includes data access and other services
- **Resources**: Stores shared resources like styles and images
